# 2D Ray Casting
2D Ray casting using C++ and SFML.

Ray casting is a method of simulating light by simulating each ray individually and calculating it's intersection point with an object.

In this project, rays are shot out from the cursor in each direction and stops at an intersection. You can use "R" or "Space" to re-randomize walls.

## Note:
You have to set up SFML yourself for the project to compile.
